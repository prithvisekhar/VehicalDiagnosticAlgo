Vibration during idle
Here we will study the graph of vibrtion data before the start and end of journey.
And based on change or rise in ampltiude in vibration, we can sense the presence of fault
or need of maintenace. 
Min 30 seconds of data before and at end of journey should be collected with idle vehicle.
Input
1) Accelerometer values (acceleration values form OBD sensors)
2) trip time

Output
Subplots of FFT of vibration in three axis,
First three plots are in x, y, z direction before the journey start and
next three plots are in x, y, z direction at the end of journey.
