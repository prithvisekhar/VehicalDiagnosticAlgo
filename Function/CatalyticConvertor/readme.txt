Catalytic Performance
It compares the values of O2 sensor value at upstream and downstream position. 
If the downstream O values are constant, not changing too frequently or also not changing with speed change of vehicle.
Then we can say catalytic convertor is in good convertor. 

Input
1) O2 value upstream
2) O2 value downpstream 
3) vehicle speed
4) trip time

Output
Plot of upstream and downstream with time.
plot of vehicle speed with time.
